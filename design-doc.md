# Amazon Shopping Assistant Agent Design Document

## Project Overview

This document outlines the design for an Amazon Shopping Assistant Agent that helps users shop on Amazon using natural language. The agent will be built using the Pydantic AI library as the agent framework, Flask as the backend service, and Selenium (non-headless) for web crawling and agent execution. Integration with a Telegram interface is considered a low priority.

## Project Roadmap & Milestones

### Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

**Goals:**
- Set up the Flask backend service.
- Implement basic natural language processing (NLP) capabilities using Pydantic AI.
- Develop Selenium scripts to navigate Amazon's interface and extract product information.
- Integrate the agent with the Flask backend to handle user requests.

**Success Criteria:**
- The agent can accept natural language shopping requests.
- The agent can navigate Amazon, extract product information, and return results.
- Basic error handling is in place.

### Phase 2: Enhanced Functionality

**Goals:**
- Improve NLP capabilities for better understanding and handling of complex queries.
- Implement product comparison and filtering logic.
- Add follow-up question handling and conversation management.
- Enhance error handling and logging.

**Success Criteria:**
- The agent can handle more complex shopping scenarios.
- The agent can compare and filter products based on user preferences.
- The agent can manage follow-up questions and maintain context.

### Phase 3: Integration and Optimization

**Goals:**
- Integrate the agent with a Telegram interface.
- Optimize Selenium scripts for performance.
- Implement rate limiting and anti-detection measures.
- Conduct thorough testing and debugging.

**Success Criteria:**
- The agent is integrated with Telegram and can handle user requests via the platform.
- The agent performs efficiently and avoids detection by Amazon.
- The agent passes all tests and handles edge cases gracefully.

### Phase 4: Production Readiness

**Goals:**
- Finalize documentation and setup instructions.
- Prepare for deployment and scalability.
- Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT).

**Success Criteria:**
- Comprehensive documentation is available.
- The agent is ready for deployment and can scale to handle multiple users.
- Positive feedback from UAT.

## Resource Planning

### Team Composition

- **Phase 1-2:**
  - 1 Backend Developer (Flask, Pydantic AI)
  - 1 Web Scraping Specialist (Selenium)
  - 1 NLP Specialist

- **Phase 3-4:**
  - 1 Full-Stack Developer (Flask, Telegram integration)
  - 1 QA Engineer
  - 1 DevOps Engineer

### External Dependencies

- Amazon website for product data
- Pydantic AI library
- Selenium for web crawling
- Flask for backend service
- Telegram API for integration

### Infrastructure Requirements

- Cloud hosting for the Flask backend (e.g., AWS, Heroku)
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- Logging and monitoring tools (e.g., ELK stack)

### Technical Debt Considerations

- Regular code reviews to maintain code quality
- Refactoring and optimization during each phase
- Documentation updates to reflect changes

## Agent Architecture

### Autonomy and Decision-Making

- Use Pydantic AI for natural language understanding and decision-making.
- Implement a decision tree for handling complex shopping scenarios.
- Use Selenium to interact with Amazon's interface and extract data.

### Context Management

- Maintain user session data in Flask.
- Use Pydantic AI to manage conversation context and follow-up questions.

### Personalization

- Store user preferences and past interactions.
- Use this data to personalize recommendations and improve decision-making.

## Evaluation & Testing

### Evaluation Methods

- User feedback and satisfaction surveys.
- Automated tests for decision quality and accuracy.
- Manual testing for edge cases and complex scenarios.

### Testing Approaches

- Unit tests for individual components.
- Integration tests for end-to-end functionality.
- Load testing to ensure scalability.

### Debugging and Failure Detection

- Implement comprehensive logging for all interactions.
- Use monitoring tools to detect and alert on failures.
- Regularly review logs and user feedback to identify and fix issues.

## Key Challenges & Solutions

### Anti-Bot Measures

- Use Selenium's stealth mode and human-like interactions.
- Implement rate limiting to avoid detection.

### Scaling

- Use cloud infrastructure to scale the backend service.
- Optimize Selenium scripts for performance.

### Price/Inventory Changes

- Regularly update product data and handle changes gracefully.
- Notify users of significant changes in product availability or price.

### Failed Searches

- Implement fallback mechanisms for failed searches.
- Provide users with alternative suggestions or options.

## Future Improvements

- Add support for other shopping websites.
- Implement advanced NLP techniques for better understanding.
- Explore voice-based interactions.
- Optimize performance and reduce latency.

## Conclusion

This design document outlines a comprehensive plan for developing an Amazon Shopping Assistant Agent. By following the outlined roadmap and addressing key challenges, we aim to build a robust and user-friendly agent that can assist users in shopping on Amazon effectively.
